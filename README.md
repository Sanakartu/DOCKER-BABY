```

### Running the Container

```bash
docker run --rm my-docker-image
```

### Running with Port Mapping (if applicable)

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 --rm my-docker-image
```

## Project Structure

```
.
├── Dockerfile          # Docker image definition
├── .gitignore         # Git ignore patterns

```

## Configuration

Modify the `Dockerfile` to:
- Change the base image as needed
- Add your application files
- Install required dependencies
- Configure ports and environment variables

## Development

1. Make changes to your application code
2. Rebuild the Docker image
3. Test the container locally
4. Push to your container registry when ready

## Deployment

Add deployment instructions specific to your target environment (AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, etc.)
